# BBY Service Menu Manager

A drag-and-drop service menu management tool built with **React Native + Expo**, designed for service professionals to organize their service offerings with intuitive reordering capabilities.

## ✨ Overview

This tool allows service professionals to:

- **View services grouped under sections** (Hair, Face, Nails, etc.)
- **Drag and drop to reorder both items and sections**
- **Reflect the updated order in a backend-ready structure**
- **Persist the updated order even after page refresh**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native with Expo
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Drag & Drop**: react-native-draggable-flatlist
- **Styling**: React Native StyleSheet with "girly and cunty" aesthetic

## 🔧 Core Functionality

### ✅ Menu Sections

- **Hair Services** 💇‍♀️ - Professional hair styling and treatments
- **Facial Treatments** ✨ - Rejuvenating facial care services
- **Nail Care** 💅 - Beautiful nails with professional care

### ✅ Services

Each section contains individual services with:

- **Name** and **description**
- **Duration** (formatted as "1h 30m")
- **Price** (formatted as "$75.00")

### ✅ Drag-and-Drop

- **Reorder sections** (drag entire sections up/down)
- **Reorder items within sections** (drag services and packages)
- **Visual feedback** with pink highlights during drag operations
- **Persistent ordering** saved to database

### ✅ Service Packages

- **Named packages** that include multiple services by reference
- **Total duration** and **total price** calculations
- **Flexible grouping** within any section

## 🧱 Database Schema

The application uses a robust PostgreSQL schema designed for production use:

### Core Tables

- **`users`** - Multi-user support with UUID primary keys
- **`service_sections`** - Menu sections with display ordering
- **`services`** - Individual services with pricing and duration
- **`service_packages`** - Service packages with bundled offerings
- **`package_services`** - Junction table for package-service relationships

### Key Features

- **UUID-based identification** for security and distribution
- **Display order constraints** to prevent duplicate ordering
- **Soft delete support** with `is_active` flags
- **Audit trails** with timestamps and change logging
- **Multi-tenant architecture** with user isolation

See [docs/database-schema.md](docs/database-schema.md) for complete schema documentation.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Expo CLI (`npm install -g @expo/cli`)

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The backend will start on `http://localhost:3002`

### Database Setup

```bash
# Create database
createdb bby_service_menu

# Run schema (see database-setup.sql)
psql -d bby_service_menu -f database-setup.sql

# Insert sample data (see insert-mock-data.sql)
psql -d bby_service_menu -f insert-mock-data.sql
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start Expo development server
npx expo start

# Run on iOS simulator or scan QR code with Expo Go app
```

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Drag & Drop System

- **Smooth reordering** of sections and services
- **Visual feedback** with pink highlights
- **Touch-friendly** long-press activation
- **Scrollable content** when not editing

### ✅ Data Persistence

- **Real-time API integration** with PostgreSQL backend
- **Automatic saving** of all order changes
- **Network resilience** with fallback IP detection
- **Multi-user support** with isolated data

### ✅ User Experience

- **Intuitive interface** with clear visual hierarchy
- **Responsive design** optimized for mobile
- **Girly aesthetic** with hot pink theme and emojis
- **Smooth animations** and transitions

## 🔍 Tradeoffs & Design Decisions

### Frontend Architecture

- **Single component approach** for simplicity and maintainability
- **Inline styles** for rapid prototyping and easy customization
- **Conditional rendering** to handle edit vs. view modes efficiently

### Backend Design

- **Two-step update process** for ordering to prevent constraint violations
- **Comprehensive error handling** with detailed logging
- **Flexible network detection** for development across different environments

### Performance Considerations

- **Efficient database queries** with proper indexing
- **Optimized drag operations** with minimal re-renders
- **Smart caching** of network responses

## 🐛 Known Issues & Improvements

### Current Limitations

- **Network dependency** requires backend to be running
- **Single user focus** (though schema supports multi-user)
- **Limited validation** on frontend input

### Future Enhancements

- **Offline support** with local storage fallback
- **Real-time collaboration** between multiple users
- **Advanced pricing rules** and discount systems
- **Service availability** and booking integration
- **Analytics dashboard** for service performance

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### State Management

- **React hooks** for local state management
- **Efficient re-rendering** with proper dependency arrays
- **Optimistic updates** for better perceived performance

### API Design

- **RESTful endpoints** following best practices
- **Consistent response format** with success/error handling
- **Proper HTTP status codes** and error messages

### Database Design

- **Normalized structure** to prevent data duplication
- **Referential integrity** with proper foreign key constraints
- **Scalable architecture** supporting large service catalogs

## 📱 Mobile-First Design

The application is designed specifically for mobile use:

- **Touch-optimized** drag and drop interactions
